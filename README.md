# ðŸŒ¦ Weather Data â€“ Machine Learning Algorithms

This project applies various **Machine Learning algorithms** to a **weather dataset** to explore different predictive and classification approaches.  
The goal is to analyze and model weather patterns using both **supervised** and **unsupervised** techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithms Implemented

### ðŸ”¹ Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression** â€“ Predicts continuous weather parameters (e.g., temperature).
- **Logistic Regression** â€“ Classifies weather conditions into categories (e.g., rain/no rain).
- **Decision Tree** â€“ Tree-based classification and regression for weather prediction.
- **Random Forest** â€“ Ensemble method for improved classification/regression accuracy.
- **Naive Bayes** â€“ Probabilistic classification based on Bayes' theorem.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** â€“ Instance-based classification using nearest neighbors.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** â€“ Finds optimal boundaries for classification.

### ðŸ”¹ Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means Clustering** â€“ Groups similar weather patterns into clusters.
- **K-Medoids Clustering** â€“ Similar to K-Means but more robust to outliers.
- **Hierarchical Clustering** â€“ Builds a hierarchy of clusters for weather data grouping.

### ðŸ”¹ Association Rule Mining
- **Apriori Algorithm** â€“ Discovers relationships between weather features.
